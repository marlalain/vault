# What is Scala?

- Pure Expression Oriented Language
	- Everything is an expression
	- Every expression computes to a value
	- Every value has a type
	- Every value is an object, even function
	- No `goto`, no `break`, no `continue`, inferred return, inferred semicolons
	- Less unnecessary curly braces `{}` (especially in Scala 3), less parentheses `()`
- "Scala"ble language
	- Regular
	- Concise
	- Powerful, not "just" pretty
