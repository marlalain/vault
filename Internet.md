	<p>Partial map of the Internet based on the January 15, 2005 data found on opte.org. Each line is drawn between two nodes, representing two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP addresses</a>. The length of the lines are indicative of the delay between those two nodes. This graph represents less than 30% of the lass C networks reachable by the data collection program in early 2005.</p>
