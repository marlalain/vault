# Why?

To catch bugs (in some level), to ensure quality, knowledge transfer, increased team awareness and finding alternative solutions.

> One manager wrote how code review in her view is a  “discipline of explaining your code to your peers [that] drives a higher standard of coding. I think the process is even more important than the result.”

\- Expectations, Outcomes, and Challenges Of Modern Code Review (page 5)

# Rules of Engagement

## As an author... provide sufficient context

> If content is king, then **context** is God

\- Gary Vaynerchuck

Provide meaningful context on **why** you made the changes you made

## As a reviewer...

> **Ask**, don't tell
