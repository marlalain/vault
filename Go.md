**Go** is a [statically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_typing "Static typing"), [compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language "Compiled language") [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") designed at [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google") by [Robert Griesemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer_(computer_programmer) "Robert Griesemer (computer programmer)"), [Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike "Rob Pike"), and [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson "Ken Thompson"). Go is [syntactically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages) "Syntax (programming languages)") similar to [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) "C (programming language)"), but with [memory safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety "Memory safety"), [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science) "Garbage collection (computer science)"), [structural typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system "Structural type system"), and [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes "Communicating sequential processes")-style [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science) "Concurrency (computer science)"). The language is often referred to as **Golang** because of its former domain name, `golang.org`, but the proper name is Go.
